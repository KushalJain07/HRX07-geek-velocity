# Questify ‚Äì AI-Powered Gamification Engine (Web code)

EduQuest is a next-generation educational platform designed to revolutionize how students learn and engage with academic content. This repository contains the **React-based web application** built for teachers and administrators. The goal is to deliver fast, scalable, and intuitive tools for content management and student monitoring‚Äîwhile seamlessly integrating with the gamified learning experience on mobile.

## üåç About the Platform

EduQuest bridges two interfaces:

* **Admin Section:** Tailored for teachers and admins to upload, manage, and structure academic content. Built for speed and productivity.
* **Student Section:** Designed for students to experience learning through interactive missions, gamified feedback loops, and adaptive learning paths.

At its core, EduQuest transforms **structured teacher notes** into **missions, quizzes, and learning modules**. These are not static documents‚Äîthey‚Äôre living, evolving experiences. AI analyzes the notes, restructures them for modular flow, and gamifies the content to boost engagement.

## üö∏ Student Experience (Mobile App Side ‚Äì Context)

Although this repo only includes the web portion, it is important to understand the full flow.

1. Students begin with an **AI-powered diagnostic test** to determine their cognitive learning style‚Äîvisual, auditory, kinesthetic, or hybrid.
2. Based on this style, content is **adaptively delivered** to match how they learn best.
3. As students complete learning missions, they:

   * Earn rewards
   * Level up digital AI pets
   * Climb leaderboards
   * Unlock badges and achievements
4. Slack in progress? Pets may lose XP or evolve backwards‚Äîcreating a subtle behavioral loop that promotes consistency and care.
